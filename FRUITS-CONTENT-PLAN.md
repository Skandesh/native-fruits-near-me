# Native Fruits Discovery Platform - Content Structure

## Platform Concept
Transform from city walking tours to a seasonal native fruits discovery platform that helps users find what fruits are naturally growing in their region during specific seasons.

## New Content Structure

### 1. Regional Categories (Replace Cities)
Instead of cities, we'll organize by:
- **North America** (USA, Canada, Mexico)
- **South America** (Brazil, Peru, Colombia, etc.)
- **Europe** (Mediterranean, Northern, Eastern, Western)
- **Asia** (Southeast, East, South, Central)
- **Africa** (North, Sub-Saharan, East, West)
- **Oceania** (Australia, New Zealand, Pacific Islands)

### 2. Seasonal Categories
Each region will have seasonal guides:
- **Spring Fruits** (March-May)
- **Summer Fruits** (June-August)
- **Autumn/Fall Fruits** (September-November)
- **Winter Fruits** (December-February)

### 3. Individual Fruit Profiles
Each fruit page includes:
- Harvest seasons by region
- Nutritional information
- Health benefits
- Identification tips
- Traditional uses
- Recipe suggestions
- Sustainability status

## Proposed SEO Pages

### Primary Pages (6 main pages - same as current architecture)
1. **North America Seasonal Fruits Guide**
2. **Mediterranean Europe Seasonal Fruits**
3. **Southeast Asia Tropical Fruits**
4. **South America Exotic Fruits**
5. **Africa Native Fruits Guide**
6. **Australia & Oceania Seasonal Fruits**

### Content Example Structure
For each page, include:
- Regional overview of fruit biodiversity
- Seasonal availability calendar
- Top 10 native fruits for that region
- Foraging/wild harvesting guidelines
